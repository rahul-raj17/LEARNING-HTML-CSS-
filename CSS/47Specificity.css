}

div .red-p{
    color: blue;
} 

ye tino me kaun sa css apply hoga upar wale html me
ye specificity ka rule decide karega kaun apply hoga

Answer
More specific rule will get more value


General Rule
● !important will override every thing
• Inline can override everything except !important
● External will work according to specificity

Specificity Rule
● (#) Id selector has highest value
• (*) Universal selector has lowest value

Specificity Rule Trick (Point System)
● 10,000 point to !important
• 1000 to inline
● 100 to id
• 10 to class, attribute or pseudo-class
● 1 for element selector & pseudo-elements
• O to universal selector


1point p{
Color: green;
}

10 point.red-p{
Color: red;
}

11 point div Ired-p{
Color: blue;
}


Note: if same rule written two or more times in external sheet then last
rule will be applicable
